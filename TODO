ATPDEC TODO List

- Could be useful to read data directly from /dev/dsp

- False color generation give various results , from good to very poor.
  Temperature calibration for IR channel could be helpful in this area.

- GUI : I'm not a GUI man , but if someone want to do the job ....

- Optimisation : Don't do anything in order to run fast. There is plenty
  possibility to increase performance (but on my 1.7GHz celeron , it's
  already faster than real time...)
